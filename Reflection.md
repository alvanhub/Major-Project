# Major Project Reflection

- One of the hardest problems for me was creating the Ai enemy and getting it to act the way I wanted it to. I had no idea on how to do this as it was not as simpleas i had presumed. at one point it was somewhat the way i wanted it but still was not what i had envisioned.

- I did solve this problem and was able to make the Ai work how i wanted with justa little thinking and a little help. In the end it was not extremely comlicated once i understood how to do it.

- If i were to do this again I would make sure to do all the easy stuff and do it the right way as when making this prgram i had alot of trial and error and it costed me time, so if i were able to make sure to get past all of that, i could have added alot more to my program.

- In the end i did complete all the need to have and made, at the very minimum the game i wanted to make.
