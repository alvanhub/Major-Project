# Major Project Proposal

## Description
For my project my goal is to make a 2D space ship shooter that is very versatile with a unique and smooth movement system and multiple gamemodes. there will be multiple types of enemies and player classes that I want to be able to implement as well as a multiplayer feature where two or multiple players will face off. I want to keep the game optional and have it so that i can make multiple different gamemodes that fit the games style.

## Need To Have List
- Player avatar 
- player movement system
- Bullet system
- AI controlled enemies
- Statistics for enemies and player
- Atleast two enemy classes
- Atleast two player classes
- player sprite 
- enemy sprite
