# Major Project Proposal

## beta test 1 by Nirjhar
- feedback given: spelt cleared wrong
- changes made: fixed the spelling of cleared

## beta test 2 by Jordie
- feedback given: 
    - menus and options need to look better, everything else looks great
    - need to explain what red button does
    - don't know how to leave optons
    - spawing enemies in practice doesn't work after you move
    - should be able to play multiple games without refreshing
    - maybe different enemies
    - provide a way to learn about an enemy. what their healt is, what they do
    - this game seems like it is capable of having powerups. They could be things 
      that spawn on the map or things you buy from a store (just an idea)
- changes made:
    - added enemy description
    - added explanation to red button's
    - enemies can now spawn in practice after moving
    - can now play multiple games without refreshing
    - added info on how to leave options and other screens
